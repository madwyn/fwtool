# fwtool

This tool is a work in-progress.

It's written in a mixture of C and C++. It also requires C++14 compatible compilers.

The goal is to write a modular, clear and easy to understand tool for packing/unpacking the firmware.

# Progress

Decrypt/encrypt FDAT chunk.
~~Unpack/pack the FirmwareData chunks~~
